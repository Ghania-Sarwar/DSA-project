Resume Screening using DSA Concepts 

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project leverages Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts along with the Ollama AI model to build an efficient resume screening system. The system automatically analyzes resumes, extracts key skills, and ranks candidates based on job descriptions.

ðŸ”¹ Features

âœ… Resume Parsing â€“ Extracts candidate information (name, contact, skills, experience, education).
âœ… Keyword Matching â€“ Uses Trie, Hash Maps, and Sets to efficiently compare resumes with job descriptions.
âœ… Skill Ranking & Scoring â€“ Implements Heaps & Priority Queues to rank resumes based on job fit.
âœ… Ollama AI Model â€“ AI-driven candidate evaluation and recommendation.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

Programming Language â€“ Python / C++

Data Structures Used â€“ Trie, Hash Map, Heap, Graph, BST

AI Model â€“ Ollama

Libraries â€“ NLTK, SpaCy, Pandas, NumPy, OpenAI/Ollama API
